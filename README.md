# GitHub User Activity

In this project, I built a simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal. This project utilized working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building a simple CLI application.

You can challenge yourself by creating one [GitHub User Activity](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity).
